# data_dive

Workshop material from Smart Cville Drug Crime Data Deep Dirve event on 2018-02-07.

If you dont like messy with package installs and do like Docker. [Jeff Xing's got you, with a ready to roll RStudio server image](https://github.com/jfx319/datadive2018-02-07), with nice instructions to boot!

Contains:

* An Rmd with my ioslides.

* A walkthough code script with all of the slide code and them some to fully reproduce all the figures in the deck. So you can run lines/chunks yourself and see the magic happen.

* A fill-along code script with empty slots for more advanced users to type along and try to guess the write calls. DataCamp style but without the helpful error messages or hints.
